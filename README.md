# historic-weather

Application URL if you run the application locally:

http://localhost:8080/historic-weather/home

This is a Springboot application with a H2 in memory DB initialized every time you start the application.

To run application please go to your checked out project directory, and run

./gradlew bootRun

A more staightforward way to run the application is that from any linux/mac, you can run:

java -jar historic-weather-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

I do not have a windows machine, so I cannot say this will work for windows or not.

All above notes applied to my MAC Book. You can find the application screen shot in the project: application_screen_shot_on_mac.png
