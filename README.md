Application URL if you run the application locally:

This is a Springboot application with a H2 in memory DB initialized every time you start the application.

# run application on linux/mac:

To run application please go to your checked out project directory, and run

./gradlew bootRun

A more staightforward way to run the application is that from any linux/mac, on any terminal, you can run:

java -jar historic-weather-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

# run application on windows 10:

I do not have a windows machine, so I cannot say this will work for windows or not.
